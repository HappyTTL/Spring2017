{\large\bf ACKNOWLEDGEMENT}\vspace{0.3in}
\end{center}
\par First and foremost I would like to thank my thesis advisor Professor Shivendra S. Panwar for his invaluable support, inspiration, patience and guidance throughout my research at New York University. I have learned a lot from his insightful comments and constructive criticisms which discovered my faltered steps and would continue to benefit my future career. I also want to gratefully and sincerely thank Dr. Pei Liu for his generous advice and suggestions to my research. The discussions with him are always inspiring and helpful.
\par Besides my advisor, I would like to thank the rest of my proposal and thesis committee: Professor Sundeep Rangan, Professor Henry Bertoni and Professor Elza Erkip, for their insightful comments and encouragement.
\par Special thanks to Ms. Fraida Fund and Mr. S.Amir Hosseini for their technical support of my project. My sincere thanks also goes to Dr. Yang Xu, Dr. Zizhong Cao, Dr. Juan Liu, Dr. Luqin Wang, Mr. Liyang Sun and Dr. Guibin Tian, who helped me to survive and stay sane in graduate school. Because of all of them, my life at New York is much more enjoyable. I also want to thank my fellow labmates: Dr. Shunyuan Ye, Dr. Sha Hua, Dr. Ayaskant Rath, Dr. Sanjay Goyal, Mr. Nicolas Barati and Mr. Georgios Kyriakou, for the stimulating discussions and all the fun we have had in the last few years.
\par Last but not the least, I would like to thank my dear husband, Jue Li, for his continuous caring and love. Without him, the achievements of my thesis are impossible. I also want to thank my lovely cat, Celia, who helps me to find inner peace. Finally, I would like to thank my parents and my younger brother for their persistent support and encouragement.
